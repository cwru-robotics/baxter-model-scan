# model_acquisition
This package will contain software to perform model acquisition by moving a robot's wrist joint in front of a point cloud acquiring sensor, placing an object on a platform attached to the joint, then performing incremental scans.

Currently, only the Baxter robot by Rethink Robotics is supported.
